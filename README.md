## Procedures
Procedure contains some brainfuck code which will be executed when procedure called. Procedures named only by letter sequences. To call porcedure you should put it name and `;` after it. Procedures could call other procedures(untested). You are free to define procedure inside a loop, but **this could lead to a severe memory leak.**<br>
```
procedure_name{...}
```
<br>
Calling it:<br>

```
procedure_name;
```

## Hello, world!
Here is code of "Hello, world!" with use of procdeures.
```
h{++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++
 .>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++.
 ------.--------.>+.>.}h;
 ```
 To test this code:<br> 
 ```
 $ cd bin/
 $ ./pbf < ../examples/hello_world.pbf
 Hello world!
 $
 ```
